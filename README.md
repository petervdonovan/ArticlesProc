# ArticlesProc
For scanning and statistically describing the syntax of JSTOR articles downloaded using the JSTOR DfR tool.

## Summary
This repository contains all of the code that I used in my high school AP Research project, in which I set out to answer two questions: Do writers use different levels of complexity depending on the demands of their particular subject matter? If they do, then is a writerâ€™s syntactic complexity related to their effectiveness, and the frequency with which they are cited?

In order to understand the articles that I had downloaded from JSTOR, I had to create object models to represent both articles in their database and articles that were cited by articles in their database; additionally, I had to model contributors, search for them, and identify them by their names. The software is designed to keep performance reasonable and to do the processing in steps, saving the output of each step to pickle files. 

The results/conclusions of my research, along justification and explanation of some of my slightly interesting statistical methods, can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QfdGZs7ytmhpbKE_OEpEeM-gj0pv6BV-n5bErsOk7DM/edit?usp=sharing).
